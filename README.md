## Background

The Powergate JS Client is built on top of the [Powergate](https://github.com/textileio/powergate/) gRPC APIs and contains the logic that makes it straight-forward to build those APIs into JavaScript-based systems. Using the Powergate JS Client requires access to a running instance of the Powergate. Find details on [setting up the Powergate here](https://github.com/textileio/powergate/#installation).

The JS Client provides access to the full Powergate API and is therefore, does not directly manage access-control. If you plan to use the Powergate JS Client in user-facing systems, we recommend running additional middleware.

## Install

```
npm i @textile/powergate-client
```

## Usage

Start by creating an instance of the client.

```typescript
import { createPow } from '@textile/powergate-client'

const host = 'http://0.0.0.0:6002' // or whatever powergate instance you want

const pow = createPow({ host })
```

Many APIs are immediately available and don't require authorization.

```typescript
const { status, messageList } = await pow.health.check()

const { peersList } = await pow.net.peers()
```

Other APIs require authorization. The main API you'll interact with is the Filecoin File System (FFS), and it requires authorization. First, create a new FFS instance.

```typescript
const { token } = await pow.ffs.create() // save this token for later use!
```

Currently, the returned auth token is the only thing that gives you access to your FFS instance at a later time, so be sure to save it securely.

Once you have an auth token, either by creating a new FFS instance or by reading one you previously saved, set the auth token you'd like the Powergate client to use.

```typescript
pow.setToken(authToken)
```

Now, the FFS API is available for you to use.

```typescript
import fs from 'fs'

// get wallet addresses associated with your FFS instance
const { addrsList } = await pow.ffs.addrs()

// create a new address associated with your ffs instance
const { addr } = await pow.ffs.newAddr('my new addr')

// get general info about your ffs instance
const { info } = await pow.ffs.info()

// cache data in IPFS in preparation to store it using FFS
const buffer = fs.readFileSync(`path/to/a/file`)
const { cid } = await pow.ffs.addToHot(buffer)

// store the data in FFS using the default storage configuration
const { jobId } = await pow.ffs.pushConfig(cid)

// watch the FFS job status to see the storage process progressing
const cancel = pow.ffs.watchJobs((job) => {
  if (job.status === JobStatus.CANCELED) {
    console.log('job canceled')
  } else if (job.status === JobStatus.FAILED) {
    console.log('job failed')
  } else if (job.status === JobStatus.SUCCESS) {
    console.log('job success!')
  }
}, jobId)

// watch all FFS events for a cid
const cancel = pow.ffs.watchLogs((logEvent) => {
  console.log(`received event for cid ${logEvent.cid}`)
}, cid)

// get the current desired storage configuration for a cid (this configuration may not be realized yet)
const { config } = await pow.ffs.getCidConfig(cid)

// get the current actual storage configuration for a cid
const { cidinfo } = await pow.ffs.show(cid)

// retreive data from FFS by cid
const bytes = await pow.ffs.get(cid)

// senf FIL from an address managed by your FFS instance to any other address
await pow.ffs.sendFil(addrsList[0].addr, '<some other address>', 1000)
```

There are also several useful examples included in the `*.spec.ts` files of this repo.
